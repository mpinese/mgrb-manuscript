## Terms of use for the SweGen dataset (release 20180409)
##
########################################################################

All data in the SweGen dataset are human allele frequencies estimated
from aggregates across large sample groups, rendering contributing
individuals non-identifiable.  The method used for estimating the
frequencies is described in the corresponding publication.  Data is
versioned and frequencies in different data versions may be different.
No individual level genetic data is contained in this dataset.  We
encourage the use and publication of frequency data for specific
targeted sets of variants (for instance, assessing a set of candidate
causal variants observed in a collection of rare disease patients).

By accessing the data you agree to the following terms and conditions,
irrespective of the method used to retrieve the data (for example vcf
file download or variant query through Beacon or other methods):

1.  You are allowed to freely search the data at the SweFreq website,
    and download any files containing allele frequency data made
    available on this site after registration.

2.  The data may not be used to attempt to identify any individual in
    this or other studies.

3.  Any published study that includes processing of the data
    shall include the data version used, acknowledge the original
    study with the sentence "The SweGen allele frequency data was
    generated by Science for Life Laboratory", and cite the following
    publication: SweGen: A whole-genome data resource of genetic
    variability in a cross-section of the Swedish population.  Ameur et
    al., Eur J Hum Genet 2017; (doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2017.130)

4.  The data may be redistributed in original or modified form, but must
    always be distributed together with the file "terms_of_use.txt"
    that is stored together with the data and available here
    [https://swefreq.nbis.se/#/downloadData/], and any redistributed
    data derived from the SweGen data set must follow those terms and
    conditions.

########################################################################

This dataset is based on individuals from population-based
cross-sectional studies.  No phenotype information has been used as
inclusion criteria in the dataset.  Individuals with common diseases
occur at the general population prevalence of the disease.  As a
consequence, genetic variants contributing to disease risk occur in
the dataset at the general population frequency.  There is no explicit
or implicit guarantee that the genetic variants in the dataset do not
contribute to risk of disease.
