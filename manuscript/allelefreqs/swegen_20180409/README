I. SweGen variant frequency dataset (release 20180409)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The files in this folder contains frequencies of single nucleotide
vatiants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs) calculated from the 1000
in the SweGen dataset, aligned to the hg19 (GRCh37) genome assembly.

Updated in this release:

	Allele frequencies on the sex chromosomes have been recalculated
	after correcting the ploidy in male samples. First, heterozygote
	calls in non-pseudoautosomal regions of male samples were changed
	to "missing" and then the genotype fields were modified using
	the bcftools (v1.6) plugin fixploidy.

III. How to use the SV data for filtering analyses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way to use the SV data for filtering is to use the
wgs-structvar pipeline, https://github.com/NBISweden/wgs-structvar.
Using this ensures that the same protocol is used as in this analysis.
Just copy the SV file into the mask_cohort subdirectory of the
wgs-structvar directory and add 'mask_cohort' to the steps argument
when running the pipeline.  The default is to filter everything with a
95% reciprocal overlap.  This can be configured with the two parameters
'--sg_mask_ovlp' and '--no_sg_reciprocal'.  If you want to relax the
filtering by allowing rare events to be kept you have to preprocess the
SV file, example with removing singleton events with awk:

    awk '$NF>1{print}' <SV file> > filtered.bed

If you want to do the filtering manually it can be done like this with
bedtools:

    bedtools intersect -header -v -a <your file> -b <SV file> -f 0.95 -r
