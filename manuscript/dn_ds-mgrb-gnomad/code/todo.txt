* Filter pop'n down to EUR high confidence
* Tweak filters so that GnomAD and MGRB are NOT included (1000G EUR only?).  Or use MGRB + GnomAD combined freq as threshold... might make more sense.
* SNVs only
* All variants for matched VEP annot.
* How to deal with marginals?  How about differential coverage?  Linkage going to be a real problem.
