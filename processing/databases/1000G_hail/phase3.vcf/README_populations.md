#Populations

This file describes the population codes where assigned to samples collected for the 1000 Genomes project. These codes are used to organise the files in the data_collections' project data directories and can also be found in column 11 of many sequence index files.

There are also two tsv files, which contain the population codes and descriptions for both the sub and super populations that were used in phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project:
